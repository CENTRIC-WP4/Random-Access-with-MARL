# Random-Access-with-MARL

Author: **Muhammad Awais Jadoon**; Organization: **Interdigital Europe**

The repository contains RL-gym environment for random access in wireless networks. The repository may be used to design random access techniques that are traffic-aware and service-aware. 

Different reward functions are provided to test the performance using different traffic arrival models at the UEs. 

Unlike regular traffic arrival in slotted ALOHA theroatical analysis, one may use custom traffic arrival models to learn RA techniques. We will* also provide traffic models that can be used.  

The following command may be used to run a random policy provided. 

`python main.py`
